# 7a. 8 Data Standards
## 7a. 8.1 Requirement for standardised business data

For the Open Banking Standard to reach its full potential, common business semantics (i.e. the meaning and understanding of data) and data consistency must be addressed.

A Data Standard (reference data model) is therefore needed to simplify and standardise data required for the Open Banking API. This is vital in ensuring that common data is made available in a uniform and consistent manner. Harmonisation will also allow non-standardised proprietary data to be made available in a common standardised way, enabling consistent usage.

For example, if the Open Banking API is used to source interest rates for personal current accounts and business accounts, each provider of that information (operating under the Open Banking Standard) would make that data available in a uniform and consistent structure, so that it can be called upon in an interoperable manner. It is recognised that harmonisation across all institutions represents a challenge.

# 7a. 8.2 Reference data model

The reference data model will describe data that is shared under the Open Banking Standard in a manner that is technology-neutral, consistent, reusable and well defined. It will form a library of structured and individual business components, data components and data structures (data types or patterns) described in a uniform notation. The model will be used by all those that adhere to the Open Banking Standard (a similar approach has been implemented by the World Customs Organisation). ([ref19](htp://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/facilitaton/resources/~/media/70998C307D3C47C996DB047B664B92AE.ashx))

Data sets will be developed based on the scope of the data necessary to support the functionality of the core. Data elements and code lists will be aligned to the greatest extent possible with existing international data standards. Over time, as the scope of the data extends so too will the reference data model.

At this stage, it is still open to further investigation whether existing data models can be reused, such as the ISO 20022 Financial Repository ([ref20](htps://www.iso20022.org/fnancial_repository.page)), or whether the Open Banking Standard will need to define and maintain a separate reference data model.

For further detail on existing data standards, please refer to Appendix 7: Existing data standards.

# 7a. 9 Open Data

Open data (as defined in Chapter 5) should be accessible via the Open Banking API and have its terminology harmonised through the reference data model (see section 8.2). Open data should form part of the core Open Banking API and therefore needs to be consistently implemented across all organisations.

Open data should also adhere to the principles of open access and treatment of IP (such as codes, software, reference data, etc.). The licence rights to use open data need to be clear and potentially included as a field within the JSON.

# 7c. 11. Approach to Open Data

By definition, there is no reason to restrict access to truly open data. Therefore, there is no need to prevent unauthorised access to open data (although there may be a need to restrict access for other reasons, such as preventing denial of service (DOS) attacks). If open data is to be accessed via the same API that provides access to customersâ€™ accounts, provision must be made for a level of access that does not require authentication (permission level zero, as opposed to no authentication).

There may be a need to protect the integrity of open data and prevent alteration of open data by bad actors. Therefore, the infrastructure used to provide access to open data should be secured to prevent unauthorised alteration. Authentication of the source of the data may also be required.

Finally, if personal data is anonymised in order to facilitate its publication as open data, care must be taken to ensure that the steps taken to anonymise it preclude de-anonymisation (including through the combination of multiple open data sets). There is more discussion in chapter 9.
